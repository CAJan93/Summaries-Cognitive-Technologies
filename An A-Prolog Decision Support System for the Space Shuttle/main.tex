Summary: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{inroduction}
    \item Build medium-sized logical program for Retraction Control System (RCS)
    \item To execute a manouver, you have to finde a plan, even if there is malfunction. A system should find an alternative sequence of instructions, if the one that you wanted to do is not possible, because of malfunctions.
    \item \textbf{system`s design}
    \item Java interface for easier data input
    \item System can do (1)  (2) give me a list of max k instructions to reach a goal.
    \item System produces program? Program is passed to solver. Solver outputs stable model. checker checks, if this is a possible model of the program. 
    \item \textbf{Pumbing Module}
    \item simulate space shuttle by directed graph. Nodes are tanks and pipe junctions, arcs are labled by valves.
    \item input of system describing plumbing is directed graph describing system in its current state and list of faulty elements. 
    \item
    \item \textbf{conclusion}
    \item ...
\end{itemize}


Questions: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item A-Prolog vs. Prolog vs. ASP?
    \item lp-function is a program that is able to produce an output for every possible inpt in its domain, correct?
\end{itemize}
